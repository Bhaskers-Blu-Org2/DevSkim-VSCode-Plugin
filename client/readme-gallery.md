# README

DevSkim is a framework of IDE plugins and Language analyzers that provide inline security analysis in the dev environment as the developer writes code. It is designed to work with multiple IDEs (VS, VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.), and has a flexible rule model that supports multiple programming languages. The idea is to give the developer notification as they are introducing a security vulnerability in order to fix the issue at the point of introduction, and to help build awareness for the developer.

## PUBLIC PREVIEW

DevSkim is currently in public preview. We're looking forward to working with the community to improve both the scanning engines and rules over the next few months, and welcome your feedback and contributions! You can find us at https://github.com/Microsoft/DevSkim
